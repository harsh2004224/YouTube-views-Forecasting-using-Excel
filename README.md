Forecasting is the process of making predictions based on past and present data.
Benifts: It helps reduce risks and make better financial decisions that increase profit margins, cash flow, improve resource allocation, and create more opportunities for growth.

I have used 3 methods to do Forecasting in Excel.
1. function
2. graph trendline
3. forecast sheet
